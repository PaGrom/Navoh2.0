test

Simple test program that finds the lines on the image by LSD library and draws the result with OpenCV

Usage:

	./test <image name>

test_webcam

Recognises rectangles in the frames captured from webcam and paints those lines in red. It uses functions and classes from pratice2013, containing rectangle-finding algorithm and usage of LSD lidrary. Coordinates of points of the lines must fit in Delta to make a connection. Delta can be chosen manually. It has a memory leak at some point, i don`t know where at this moment :) But it`s a working example.
